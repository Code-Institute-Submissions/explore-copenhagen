### Strategy

The purpose of creating this website is to facilitate the tourists and travellers to find top attractions in 
Copenhagen, Denmark. While travelling for pleasure / business or having a few hours stop over at the airport, it can be time 
consuming and difficult to find out which places to visit. By few clicks user can easily find a list of top attracions in 
the city. User can also use Google Map to find a specific attraction, hotel or restaurant.

### Scope

A simple responsive website that provide information of top attracions. It also provide information about the
nearest hotel and restaurant to that particular attracion. In case user need particular information about anything, contact
form is available.

### Structure

The website consist of one page. It contains a little history of Copenhagen and Denmark. A dropdown button for users
to sort the attracions from two main points of the city. Google Maps are available to search for anyother attraction, hotel
or restaurant for the users. Finally if user need any other information to plan trip, user can contact by clicking on plan 
your trip. User will be informed after the query is sent.

### Skeleton

Wireframes are created using balsamiq. Link to the wireframes and PDF file is available under wireframes. The design of the 
website is the same for desktop and tablet however on mobile screen the content will be re-arranged. The user will move from 
top to the bottom.
